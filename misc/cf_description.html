<h3 id="event-tracker">Event Tracker</h3>
<p>Using this addon you can view detailed information about the <strong>events</strong> that are triggered by the game.
</p>
<p>Detailed information such as arguments of the event's payload for the tracked events/functions are displayed. You can
    also see which frames are monitoring specific events.</p>
<p>You can also track function calls to see time spent during the execution of the function (on a call per call base as
    well as the total execution time).</p>
<p>You have two options to track standard WoW events</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update the file <code>EventTracker_events.lua</code> yourself. The following is an example of how the contents
        of the file may look like.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>-- Events to be tracked <br />ET_TRACKED_EVENTS = {<br />  &nbsp;"PLAYER_LEVEL_UP",<br />&nbsp;"PLAYER_XP_UPDATE",<br />&nbsp;"UNIT_HEALTH"<br />};<br />-- Events to be ignored (applied when using /et registerall) <br />ET_IGNORED_EVENTS = {<br />&nbsp;"BAG_UPDATE_COOLDOWN",<br />&nbsp;"ACTIONBAR_UPDATE_COOLDOWN",<br />&nbsp;"UNIT_POWER_FREQUENT",<br />} <br /></code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add an even using the in-game slash command <code>/et add &lt;event&gt;</code>. Events added this way will not
        persist between log-in sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="be-careful-to-specify-only-valid-events">Be careful to specify only valid events.</h5>
<p>Event Tracker uses the function <code>GetFramesRegisteredForEvent()</code>, which will cause WoW to hard crash when
    it is being called with a non-existing event.</p>
<h3 id="slash-commands">Slash commands</h3>
<p>The following slash commands are available:</p>

    My goal is to keep it working under <code>retail</code> version.
